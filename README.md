# CodeAlpha_Task
Welcome to my Data Science Projects Repository!  
This collection contains beginner-friendly yet insightful projects that apply core machine learning techniques using Python and real-world datasets. Each notebook demonstrates end-to-end workflows including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model building, visualization, and performance evaluation.

# 📊 Data Science Projects Portfolio
This repository is a curated collection of beginner to intermediate-level Data Science projects that showcase practical implementation of machine learning, data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, visualization techniques, and performance evaluation using Python. Each project is thoughtfully built around real-world datasets, following clean and well-structured workflows.

🌟 Purpose
These projects were developed as part of a hands-on learning journey in Data Science. They not only highlight foundational machine learning techniques but also emphasize the importance of clear visualization, data understanding, and evaluation in model-building processes.

🌟 About
These projects were created as part of my learning journey in Data Science. Each notebook reflects thoughtful application of theory into practical implementation, with a strong focus on interpretability, performance, and visual storytelling.
